Subject: Discussion Request: Source Control Implementation for Pinnacle Care Project

Hello Everyone,

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to initiate a dialogue concerning the implementation of source control for the Pinnacle Care project. Although there have been previous conversations which have not favored the use of Bitbucket (the Sunlife-standard via Atlassian), I believe it is crucial to explore this matter further.

The purpose of establishing source control is multifaceted: it will serve as a backup and enhance the development process, particularly as we are now in the production phase. The areas I propose we place under source control are as follows:

Database source control
Views
Functions
Descriptions
Procedures
Git usage
Data tables and reference data, including insert statements and versions
Dynamic metadata: Currently, this data resides in a QA reference table and is directly applied to production. I would like to request that this is backed up independently. Additionally, I propose storing it in source control as a series of insert statements, creating a double redundancy for enhanced security.
To facilitate our source control needs, I suggest considering AWS CodeCommit as a potential solution:

Amazon AWS CodeCommit

I believe AWS CodeCommit could offer us the robustness and reliability we are seeking.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss this proposal in detail? Your input and expertise would be highly valued as we consider this essential component of our project infrastructure.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to our collaborative efforts to strengthen our development workflow.
