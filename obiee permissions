### Using SQL (for Advanced Users)

1. **Connect to the OBIEE Metadata Database**:
   - Connect to the database that stores your OBIEE metadata using a SQL tool like SQL Developer.

2. **Run SQL Queries**:
   - Execute SQL queries to extract permission details. For example:
     ```sql
     SELECT 
         PA.NAME AS USER_GROUP,
         PA.PATH AS DASHBOARD_PATH,
         PPA.PRIVILEGE AS PRIVILEGE
     FROM 
         S_NQ_ACCT PA
     JOIN 
         S_NQ_PRIV PPA ON PA.ID = PPA.PA_ID
     WHERE 
         PPA.OBJECT_TYPE = 'DASHBOARD'
     ORDER BY 
         PA.NAME;
     ```
   - This query will provide a list of user groups, dashboard paths, and their privileges.

These methods will help you view and manage the entire list of permissions at the dashboard level in OBIEE.
